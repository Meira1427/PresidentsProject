			<p>In the Presidents Slide Show application you will display a web 
			page with information about a president. A user should be able to 
			click next and previous buttons to scroll through the presidents 
			in order. They should also be able to jump to a particular president 
			by entering in their term number.</p>

			<p>As a user I can enter the presidents term number to view 
			information about the president.</p>

			<p>Make sure to include the name, image, term number, party, 
			and dates in office.</p>
			
			<p>Make sure to add at least one more interesting piece 
			of data about the president.</p>

			<p>As a user I can choose the next button to view information 
			about the next president.</p>

			<p>As a user I can choose the previous button to view 
			information about the previous president.</p>

			<p>As a user I can choose to see a filtered list of 
			presidents (for example, only the republicans).</p>

			<p>Make sure the next/previous buttons only navigate 
			through the filtered list.</p>
